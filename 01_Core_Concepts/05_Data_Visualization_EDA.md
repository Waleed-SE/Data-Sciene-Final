# Data Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## What is Data Visualization and EDA?

Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods, to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions.

## When to Use Data Visualization and EDA

- At the beginning of any data analysis project to understand data characteristics
- When communicating findings to stakeholders with varying technical backgrounds
- When looking for patterns, relationships, and anomalies in data
- When testing hypotheses or validating assumptions about data
- When making data-driven decisions that benefit from visual clarity
- Throughout the analytics lifecycle to guide further analysis

## EDA Techniques

### 1. Univariate Analysis

- **When to use**: To understand individual variable distributions
- **How to use**: Histograms, box plots, summary statistics
- **Benefits**: Reveals central tendency, spread, shape, and outliers
- **Example code**:

  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  import seaborn as sns

  # Summary statistics
  df['variable'].describe()

  # Histogram
  plt.hist(df['variable'], bins=30)
  plt.title('Distribution of Variable')
  plt.show()

  # Box plot
  sns.boxplot(y=df['variable'])
  plt.title('Box Plot of Variable')
  plt.show()
  ```

### 2. Bivariate Analysis

- **When to use**: To examine relationships between two variables
- **How to use**: Scatter plots, correlation coefficients, cross-tabulations
- **Benefits**: Identifies relationships, patterns, and dependencies
- **Example code**:

  ```python
  # Scatter plot
  plt.scatter(df['variable1'], df['variable2'])
  plt.xlabel('Variable 1')
  plt.ylabel('Variable 2')
  plt.title('Relationship between Variables')
  plt.show()

  # Correlation
  correlation = df['variable1'].corr(df['variable2'])
  print(f"Correlation: {correlation}")
  ```

### 3. Multivariate Analysis

- **When to use**: To understand complex relationships among multiple variables
- **How to use**: Correlation matrices, parallel coordinates, dimension reduction plots
- **Benefits**: Reveals complex interactions and patterns
- **Example code**:
  ```python
  # Correlation matrix
  correlation_matrix = df.corr()
  sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
  plt.title('Correlation Matrix')
  plt.show()
  ```

### 4. Time Series Analysis

- **When to use**: For temporal data
- **How to use**: Line charts, seasonal decomposition, autocorrelation plots
- **Benefits**: Reveals trends, seasonality, and cycles
- **Example code**:
  ```python
  # Time series plot
  df.set_index('date_column').plot()
  plt.title('Time Series of Variable')
  plt.show()
  ```

## LLM-Assisted Visualization and EDA

### 1. Code Generation for Visualization
