### Implementation in Python

Using the Hugging Face Transformers library for fine-tuning:

```python
from transformers import (
    AutoModelForCausalLM,
    AutoTokenizer,
    TrainingArguments,
    Trainer,
    DataCollatorForLanguageModeling
)
from datasets import load_dataset
import torch

# Load model and tokenizer
model_name = "deepseek-ai/deepseek-math-7b-base"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    device_map="auto"
)

# Prepare dataset
def preprocess_function(examples):
    # Format: Convert problems and solutions to instruction format
    texts = []
    for problem, solution in zip(examples["problem"], examples["solution"]):
        text = f"Problem: {problem}\nSolution: {solution}"
        texts.append(text)

    # Tokenize inputs
    tokenized = tokenizer(
        texts,
        padding="max_length",
        truncation=True,
        max_length=1024,
        return_tensors="pt"
    )
    return tokenized

# Load and process mathematical dataset
dataset = load_dataset("math_dataset")
tokenized_dataset = dataset.map(
    preprocess_function,
    batched=True,
    remove_columns=dataset["train"].column_names
)

# Set up training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./deepseek-math-finetuned",
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,
    gradient_accumulation_steps=4,
    learning_rate=1e-5,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    warmup_steps=500,
    logging_steps=100,
    save_strategy="epoch",
    fp16=True,
    report_to="tensorboard"
)

# Set up data collator
data_collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    mlm=False
)

# Initialize trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_dataset["train"],
    eval_dataset=tokenized_dataset["validation"],
    data_collator=data_collator
)

# Start fine-tuning
trainer.train()

# Save the fine-tuned model
model.save_pretrained("./deepseek-math-finetuned-final")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("./deepseek-math-finetuned-final")
```

Using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA:

```python
from peft import (
    get_peft_model,
    LoraConfig,
    TaskType,
    prepare_model_for_kbit_training
)

# Configure LoRA
lora_config = LoraConfig(
    task_type=TaskType.CAUSAL_LM,
    r=16,  # rank
    lora_alpha=32,
    lora_dropout=0.1,
    target_modules=["q_proj", "k_proj", "v_proj", "o_proj", "gate_proj", "up_proj", "down_proj"],
    bias="none",
)

# Prepare model for PEFT
model = prepare_model_for_kbit_training(model)
model = get_peft_model(model, lora_config)

# Check trainable parameters
trainable_params = sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters() if p.requires_grad)
total_params = sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters())
print(f"Trainable parameters: {trainable_params} ({100 * trainable_params / total_params:.2f}% of total)")

# Continue with training as in the previous example
```

## Key Components of DeepSeek Math Fine-Tuning

### 1. Mathematical Dataset Preparation

Creating high-quality datasets for mathematical reasoning is crucial:

```python
# Example of creating a structured math dataset
import pandas as pd

math_examples = [
    {
        "problem": "Find the derivative of f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 3",
        "solution": "To find the derivative, we apply the power rule to each term:\n" +
                   "f'(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 5\n" +
                   "This is our final answer."
    },
    {
        "problem": "Solve the equation 2x + 7 = 15",
        "solution": "2x + 7 = 15\n" +
                   "2x = 15 - 7\n" +
                   "2x = 8\n" +
                   "x = 4"
    },
    # Add more examples...
]

math_df = pd.DataFrame(math_examples)
math_df.to_json("math_training_data.json", orient="records", lines=True)
```

### 2. Instruction Formatting

Proper formatting of mathematical problems as instructions:

```python
def format_as_instruction(problem, solution=None):
    if solution:
        # For training data
        return f"""Below is a mathematical problem. Solve it step by step.

Problem:
{problem}

Solution:
{solution}
"""
    else:
        # For inference
        return f"""Below is a mathematical problem. Solve it step by step.

Problem:
{problem}

Solution:
"""
```

### 3. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Implementing chain-of-thought reasoning for complex mathematical problems:

```python
def chain_of_thought_prompt(problem):
    return f"""Below is a challenging mathematical problem. Think through it step by step.

Problem:
{problem}

Let's break this down:
1) First, I'll understand what the problem is asking.
2) Then, I'll identify the relevant mathematical concepts and formulas.
3) Next, I'll work through the solution systematically.
4) Finally, I'll verify my answer.

Step-by-step solution:
"""
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)

Fine-tuning with human preferences for mathematical reasoning:

```python
# Simplified pseudocode for RLHF training loop
def rlhf_math_training(model, math_problems, human_preferences):
    # Generate multiple solutions for each problem
    solutions_a, solutions_b = generate_solution_pairs(model, math_problems)

    # Get human preferences between solution pairs
    preferences = human_preferences(solutions_a, solutions_b)

    # Train a reward model based on preferences
    reward_model = train_reward_model(solutions_a, solutions_b, preferences)

    # Use PPO to fine-tune the model with the reward function
    ppo_trainer = PPOTrainer(model, reward_model)
    fine_tuned_model = ppo_trainer.train(math_problems)

    return fine_tuned_model
```

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation

Enhancing mathematical reasoning with retrieval of formulas and theorems:

```python
from langchain import PromptTemplate, LLMChain
from langchain.retrievers import VectorDBRetriever

# Create a mathematical formula database
formula_retriever = VectorDBRetriever(vectorstore=formula_db)

# Template for retrieval-augmented math problem solving
template = """
Problem: {problem}

Relevant mathematical formulas and theorems:
{retrieved_formulas}

Now, let's solve this step by step:
"""

prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["problem", "retrieved_formulas"],
    template=template
)

# During inference
def solve_with_retrieval(problem):
    # Retrieve relevant formulas
    formulas = formula_retriever.get_relevant_documents(problem)
    formatted_formulas = "\n".join([f.page_content for f in formulas])

    # Generate solution with retrieved context
    chain = LLMChain(llm=fine_tuned_model, prompt=prompt)
    solution = chain.run(problem=problem, retrieved_formulas=formatted_formulas)

    return solution
```

### Model Ensembling

Combining multiple specialized mathematical models:

```python
def ensemble_math_models(problem, models, weights=None):
    """
    Use an ensemble of math models to solve a problem.

    Args:
        problem: The mathematical problem to solve
        models: List of fine-tuned mathematical models
        weights: Optional weights for each model's contribution

    Returns:
        The ensemble solution
    """
    if weights is None:
        weights = [1/len(models)] * len(models)

    # Generate solutions from each model
    solutions = []
    for model in models:
        solution = model.generate_solution(problem)
        solutions.append(solution)

    # For multiple-choice or numerical answers, use weighted voting
    if is_multiple_choice_or_numerical(solutions):
        return weighted_vote(solutions, weights)

    # For open-ended solutions, use a meta-model to synthesize
    else:
        return synthesize_solutions(problem, solutions, weights)
```
