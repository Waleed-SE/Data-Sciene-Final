# Transformers

## What are Transformers?

Transformers are a type of deep learning model architecture introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need" (2017) that revolutionized natural language processing. Unlike recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers process entire sequences in parallel using a mechanism called self-attention, allowing them to capture long-range dependencies more effectively and train much faster.

## When to Use Transformers

- When working with sequential data, especially text
- When processing long sequences where capturing dependencies across distant positions is crucial
- When computational efficiency is important (parallel processing)
- For tasks requiring contextual understanding of entire sequences
- For natural language processing tasks like:
  - Text classification
  - Named entity recognition
  - Machine translation
  - Question answering
  - Summarization
  - Text generation
- When transfer learning from pre-trained language models would be beneficial
- For multimodal tasks combining text with other data types (images, audio)

## How to Use Transformers

### Basic Implementation Approach

1. **Data Preparation**:

   - Tokenize input text
   - Convert tokens to embeddings
   - Add positional encoding to maintain sequence order

2. **Model Architecture**:

   - Encoder-decoder or encoder-only/decoder-only variants
   - Self-attention mechanism
   - Feed-forward neural networks
   - Layer normalization and residual connections

3. **Training and Fine-tuning**:
   - Pre-train on large corpora for general language understanding
   - Fine-tune on specific downstream tasks with smaller datasets

### Implementation in Python

Using the Hugging Face Transformers library:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification
import torch

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Prepare inputs
text = "Transformers are powerful models for NLP tasks."
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")

# Forward pass
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)

# Get predictions
predictions = torch.nn.functional.softmax(outputs.logits, dim=-1)
print(predictions)
```

Fine-tuning a transformer for a specific task:

```python
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load dataset
dataset = load_dataset("glue", "sst2")

# Tokenize dataset
def tokenize_function(examples):
    return tokenizer(examples["sentence"], padding="max_length", truncation=True)

tokenized_datasets = dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)

# Set up training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=64,
    warmup_steps=500,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    logging_dir="./logs",
)

# Initialize Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_datasets["train"],
    eval_dataset=tokenized_datasets["validation"],
)

# Train model
trainer.train()
```

## Types of Transformer Architectures

### 1. Encoder-Decoder Transformers

- **Examples**: Original Transformer, T5, BART
- **Applications**: Machine translation, summarization, question answering
- **Structure**: Contains both encoder and decoder components

### 2. Encoder-Only Transformers

- **Examples**: BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT
- **Applications**: Text classification, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis
- **Structure**: Contains only the encoder component, focuses on understanding context

### 3. Decoder-Only Transformers

- **Examples**: GPT series, LLaMA, PaLM
- **Applications**: Text generation, completion tasks
- **Structure**: Contains only the decoder component, focuses on generation

### 4. Specialized Transformers

- **Vision Transformers (ViT)**: For image processing
- **Audio Transformers (Wav2Vec)**: For speech recognition
- **Multimodal Transformers (CLIP)**: Combining different data types

## Key Components of Transformers

### 1. Self-Attention Mechanism

The core innovation that allows transformers to process relationships between all positions in a sequence:

```python
# Simplified self-attention implementation
def self_attention(query, key, value):
    # Calculate attention scores
    scores = torch.matmul(query, key.transpose(-2, -1)) / math.sqrt(key.size(-1))

    # Apply softmax to get attention weights
    attention_weights = torch.nn.functional.softmax(scores, dim=-1)

    # Apply attention weights to values
    output = torch.matmul(attention_weights, value)
    return output
```

### 2. Multi-Head Attention

Allows the model to focus on different parts of the sequence simultaneously:

```python
class MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, num_heads):
        super().__init__()
        self.num_heads = num_heads
        self.d_model = d_model
        self.d_k = d_model // num_heads

        self.q_linear = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.k_linear = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.v_linear = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.out = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)

    def forward(self, q, k, v, mask=None):
        batch_size = q.size(0)

        # Linear projections and reshape for multi-head attention
        q = self.q_linear(q).view(batch_size, -1, self.num_heads, self.d_k).transpose(1, 2)
        k = self.k_linear(k).view(batch_size, -1, self.num_heads, self.d_k).transpose(1, 2)
        v = self.v_linear(v).view(batch_size, -1, self.num_heads, self.d_k).transpose(1, 2)

        # Calculate attention
        scores = torch.matmul(q, k.transpose(-2, -1)) / math.sqrt(self.d_k)

        if mask is not None:
            scores = scores.masked_fill(mask == 0, -1e9)

        attention = torch.nn.functional.softmax(scores, dim=-1)
        output = torch.matmul(attention, v)

        # Reshape and project back
        output = output.transpose(1, 2).contiguous().view(batch_size, -1, self.d_model)
        return self.out(output)
```

### 3. Positional Encoding

Since transformers process all tokens simultaneously, positional encoding is added to provide information about token positions:

```python
def positional_encoding(seq_len, d_model):
    position = torch.arange(seq_len).unsqueeze(1).float()
    div_term = torch.exp(torch.arange(0, d_model, 2).float() * -(math.log(10000.0) / d_model))

    pos_encoding = torch.zeros(seq_len, d_model)
    pos_encoding[:, 0::2] = torch.sin(position * div_term)
    pos_encoding[:, 1::2] = torch.cos(position * div_term)

    return pos_encoding
```
