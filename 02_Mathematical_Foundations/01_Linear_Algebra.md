## What is Linear Algebra?

Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with vector spaces, linear mappings between these spaces, and the systems of linear equations that arise from them. It provides the mathematical foundation for many data science algorithms and techniques.

## When to Use Linear Algebra in Data Science

- When implementing machine learning algorithms from scratch
- When understanding the inner workings of existing algorithms
- When performing dimensionality reduction
- When analyzing relationships between variables
- When transforming data for visualization or modeling
- When optimizing models with gradient-based methods

## Key Linear Algebra Concepts for Data Science

### 1. Vectors and Matrices

- **When to use**: When representing collections of data points or features
- **How to use**:
  - **Vectors**: One-dimensional arrays representing points in space or features
  - **Matrices**: Two-dimensional arrays representing collections of data points or transformations
- **Benefits**: Efficient representation and manipulation of data
- **Example in Python**:

  ```python
  import numpy as np

  # Creating a vector
  v = np.array([1, 2, 3])

  # Creating a matrix
  M = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
  ```

### 2. Matrix Operations

- **When to use**: When transforming data or implementing algorithms
- **How to use**:
  - **Addition/Subtraction**: Element-wise operations between matrices of same size
  - **Multiplication**: Matrix product (not element-wise)
  - **Transpose**: Flipping matrix over its diagonal
- **Benefits**: Enables mathematical transformations and calculations
- **Example in Python**:

  ```python
  # Matrix addition
  A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
  B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
  C = A + B  # Element-wise addition

  # Matrix multiplication
  D = np.dot(A, B)  # Matrix product
  # or
  D = A @ B  # Python 3.5+ syntax

  # Transpose
  A_T = A.T
  ```

### 3. Linear Systems and Matrix Inverse

- **When to use**: When solving systems of linear equations, finding model parameters
- **How to use**:
  - **Linear systems**: Express as Ax = b and solve for x
  - **Matrix inverse**: Find A⁻¹ such that A⁻¹A = I
- **Benefits**: Critical for solving regression problems and other optimizations
- **Example in Python**:

  ```python
  # Solving linear system Ax = b
  A = np.array([[2, 1], [1, 3]])
  b = np.array([5, 8])
  x = np.linalg.solve(A, b)

  # Computing inverse
  A_inv = np.linalg.inv(A)
  ```

### 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

- **When to use**: For dimensionality reduction, understanding data variance, finding principal components
- **How to use**: Find values λ and vectors v such that Av = λv
- **Benefits**: Reveals intrinsic properties of transformations and data
- **Example in Python**:
  ```python
  # Finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors
  eigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eig(A)
  ```

### 5. Vector Spaces and Basis

- **When to use**: When understanding the space in which your data exists
- **How to use**: Identify basis vectors that span the space of your data
- **Benefits**: Provides foundation for feature engineering and dimensionality reduction
- **Example**: Representing RGB colors as 3D vectors in a color space

### 6. Orthogonality and Projections

- **When to use**: When decomposing data into components, removing correlations
- **How to use**: Project vectors onto orthogonal bases
- **Benefits**: Enables feature extraction and dimensionality reduction
- **Example in Python**:
  ```python
  # Projecting vector b onto vector a
  a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
  b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
  projection = (np.dot(a, b) / np.dot(a, a)) * a
  ```

## Applications in Data Science

### 1. Linear Regression

- **How linear algebra is used**: Solving normal equations (X^T X β = X^T y)
- **Benefits**: Efficient parameter estimation for linear models
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  # Linear regression using linear algebra
  X = np.array([[1, x1], [1, x2], ..., [1, xn]])  # Design matrix with intercept
  y = np.array([y1, y2, ..., yn])
  beta = np.linalg.inv(X.T @ X) @ X.T @ y
  ```

### 2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

- **How linear algebra is used**: Eigendecomposition of covariance matrix
- **Benefits**: Reduces dimensionality while preserving variance
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  # Simple PCA implementation
  X_centered = X - X.mean(axis=0)
  cov_matrix = np.cov(X_centered, rowvar=False)
  eigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eigh(cov_matrix)
  # Sort eigenvectors by decreasing eigenvalues
  idx = np.argsort(eigenvalues)[::-1]
  eigenvectors = eigenvectors[:, idx]
  # Project data onto principal components
  X_pca = X_centered @ eigenvectors
  ```

### 3. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

- **How linear algebra is used**: Matrix factorization as U Σ V^T
- **Benefits**: Enables dimensionality reduction, recommendation systems, image compression
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  # SVD computation
  U, S, VT = np.linalg.svd(X, full_matrices=False)
  # Low-rank approximation
  k = 2  # Number of components to keep
  X_approx = U[:, :k] @ np.diag(S[:k]) @ VT[:k, :]
  ```

### 4. Deep Learning

- **How linear algebra is used**: Matrix operations in neural network layers
- **Benefits**: Efficient computation of forward and backward passes
- **Example**: A dense layer in a neural network is essentially a matrix multiplication followed by a bias addition and activation function
